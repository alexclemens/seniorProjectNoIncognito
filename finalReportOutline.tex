\subsubsection*{\hspace{20mm}Abstract}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2cm}{2cm}

My topic for the Senior Project in the Spring is based off the research done by Professor Papoutsaki at Pomona College. Her work heavily relies on Computer Vision. A product of her research can be seen in her WebGazer online application (viewable on her personal website), which uses JavaScript to map the user?s gaze location to a point on the screen in real-time.\\\\



In order to aid Professor Papoutsaki, a professor at Pomona College who's work implements elements of computer vision, in her research we explore the act of detecting a face using a JavaScript library called CLM tracker that works in any browser and a laptop camera. 
\\

Summary of what the paper will be covering
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Improving CLM Tracker
	\item Uses JS and HTML to track the face
	\item MUCT dataset and others
	\item "In this paper, we will explore the shortcomings of the library and offer potential improvements to the existing code."
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}

Detecting where a face resides within a portrait, headshot photo of a person may seem simple, but it is no easy task. Researchers have come to find that the human face contains some general uniformities, however, there are many variables in photography of the human face

	\item Uses of Face Detection
	\item Why it might be important to study and improve
	\item CLM Tracker
